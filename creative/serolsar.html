    <title>The Mountain's Lake</title>
        <img src="../bin/seolsar.jpeg" alt="A frozen Serolsar Lake in winter">
        <p> The leaves rustle their monsoon hymns in reverence of the breeze,
        the birds chirp away their musical melodies. The trees, gentle giants
        that they are, distill the overwhelming embrace of the mighty sun into
        fuzzy kisses that warm the soul. A primitive part of the soul, nourished
        only by Mother Nature, rejoices at every moment spent in her lap. Ah,
        how brazenly my fellow intruders defile her! We have yet to learn from
        the nobler beasts, the craft of being witnessed only by prints. The icy
        air pierces my gasping lungs with the very breath of life, bestowing
        itself upon one far more blemished. How blue the sky is! Pouring color
        into the word azure, it is necklaced by the lofty snow-capped peaks, and
        soared only by the bravest of the fierce eagles. "How high does the path
        go?" The shepherd humbly smiles at my naivety.

        The treacherous trails laden with melting snows jolt me awake at every
        misstep I tread, anything less than utmost mindfulness is a slight they
        will make me pay dearly for. I feel my heart pounding through all my
        feeble layers of clothing. If I have felt alive, it is but here. Time
        itself is frozen at this heavenly lake, an eternity passes through the
        few moments I have here; yet I feel out of time to take it all in. A
        villager tells me the lake is so pure, the birds will pick up even the
        lone leaf that dares stumble into it. A local legend fables a Goddess
        resides in the lake. It must be true, for if I have felt divine it is
        but here. </p>
